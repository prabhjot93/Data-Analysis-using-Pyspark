Sharing online resources enhanced our understanding of SQL and allowed us to practice the concepts after class.","5":"Improvements for future classes:\n1. Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3.

Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4.

Additionally, providing more opportunities for practical application and hands-on exercises could strengthen participants' skills and confidence in applying what they've learned","6":"8","7":"The training materials for Weeks 1 & 2 have provided a solid foundation for participants entering the Test Analyst Programme.

The tutor was very approachable during the sessions.\n2. Everyone understood the concepts and felt comfortable asking questions about their application.\n3. SQL had the most concepts to grasp, and they were paced very well over the two weeks.\n4. The homework assignments helped me understand the SQL commands and the logic behind them.\n5. Sharing online resources enhanced our understanding of SQL and allowed us to practice the concepts after class.","5":"Improvements for future classes:\n1. Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3. Make it mandatory for students to keep their cameras on during classes, not just the tutor. This creates the feel of an actual classroom and encourages more active participation since everyone can see each other.","6":"6","7":"The study materials were very helpful for preparing for the weekly sessions, especially in getting familiar with the topics. The pre-program preparation materials were extremely useful, allowing students to read up on SQL, Power BI, and SSIS before the official study materials were provided.\n\nImprovement:\n1. Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2. An introduction to the tutor before the classes begin would help students feel more comfortable, as knowing a bit about the tutor in advance can make a big difference.","8":"BI - Pratit Doshi","9":"7","10":"8","11":"1.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1. It would be helpful if he structured the classes to allocate specific times for each topic and then set aside time for questions or to revisit explanations.\n2. Covering common types of errors encountered while working with SQL would also be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\n","12":"7 May 2024 intake","13":"NotAnswered","14":"8","15":"8","16":"6","index":82,"key":82},{"0":"2024-06-12 21:45:00.739","1":"Test Analyst","2":"8","3":"8","4":"I learn how to write technical blog and manual testing, script writing.

Overall, Ali is no doubt a very knowledgeable instructor, I just think it would be of great help if we can have a clearer structure and solid end outputs/examples for each session to really appreciate and understand the lessons.","12":"12 September 2023 intake","13":"7","14":"7","index":32,"key":32},{"0":"2023-10-10 17:39:27.316","1":"BI / Data Analyst","2":"10","3":"10","4":"I enjoyed the transition from data transformation to dashboard design, and then DAX/M querying in the context of real-life analysis","5":"It would be nice if there was a GitHub or repository for the codes used so that participants can refer to them in future sessions.

Sharing online resources enhanced our understanding of SQL and allowed us to practice the concepts after class.","5":"Improvements for future classes:\n1. Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3.

Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1. It would be helpful if he structured the classes to allocate specific times for each topic and then set aside time for questions or to revisit explanations.\n2.

Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations.

The sessions provided a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts and skills essential for the role. Additionally, the clarity of instruction and the tutor's ability to convey complex ideas in a digestible manner greatly facilitated understanding. Furthermore, the interactive nature of the sessions fostered engagement and allowed for active participation, which enhanced the learning experience. Overall, the combination of structured content, clear instruction, and interactive engagement made Week 1 & 2 training sessions particularly enjoyable and beneficial.","5":"While the Week 1 & 2 training sessions were highly effective in providing a structured approach to learning and conveying complex ideas clearly, there is still room for improvement in ensuring that the depth of understanding matches the expectations for the role. Specifically, incorporating more in-depth coverage of certain topics, such as C# concepts, could further enhance the participants' knowledge and readiness for the Test Analyst role. Additionally, providing more opportunities for practical application and hands-on exercises could strengthen participants' skills and confidence in applying what they've learned","6":"8","7":"The training materials for Weeks 1 & 2 have provided a solid foundation for participants entering the Test Analyst Programme.

The tutor was very approachable during the sessions.\n2. Everyone understood the concepts and felt comfortable asking questions about their application.\n3. SQL had the most concepts to grasp, and they were paced very well over the two weeks.\n4. The homework assignments helped me understand the SQL commands and the logic behind them.\n5. Sharing online resources enhanced our understanding of SQL and allowed us to practice the concepts after class.","5":"Improvements for future classes:\n1. Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3. Make it mandatory for students to keep their cameras on during classes, not just the tutor. This creates the feel of an actual classroom and encourages more active participation since everyone can see each other.","6":"6","7":"The study materials were very helpful for preparing for the weekly sessions, especially in getting familiar with the topics. The pre-program preparation materials were extremely useful, allowing students to read up on SQL, Power BI, and SSIS before the official study materials were provided.\n\nImprovement:\n1. Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2. An introduction to the tutor before the classes begin would help students feel more comfortable, as knowing a bit about the tutor in advance can make a big difference.","8":"BI - Pratit Doshi","9":"7","10":"8","11":"1.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1. It would be helpful if he structured the classes to allocate specific times for each topic and then set aside time for questions or to revisit explanations.\n2. Covering common types of errors encountered while working with SQL would also be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\n","12":"7 May 2024 Intake","13":"","index":81,"key":81},{"0":"2024-06-12 21:45:00.739","1":"Test Analyst","2":"8","3":"8","4":"I learn how to write technical blog and manual testing, script writing.

Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1.

Additionally, providing more opportunities for practical application and hands-on exercises could strengthen participants' skills and confidence in applying what they've learned","6":"8","7":"The training materials for Weeks 1 & 2 have provided a solid foundation for participants entering the Test Analyst Programme.

The tutor was very approachable during the sessions.\n2. Everyone understood the concepts and felt comfortable asking questions about their application.\n3. SQL had the most concepts to grasp, and they were paced very well over the two weeks.\n4. The homework assignments helped me understand the SQL commands and the logic behind them.\n5. Sharing online resources enhanced our understanding of SQL and allowed us to practice the concepts after class.","5":"Improvements for future classes:\n1. Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3. Make it mandatory for students to keep their cameras on during classes, not just the tutor. This creates the feel of an actual classroom and encourages more active participation since everyone can see each other.","6":"6","7":"The study materials were very helpful for preparing for the weekly sessions, especially in getting familiar with the topics. The pre-program preparation materials were extremely useful, allowing students to read up on SQL, Power BI, and SSIS before the official study materials were provided.\n\nImprovement:\n1. Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2. An introduction to the tutor before the classes begin would help students feel more comfortable, as knowing a bit about the tutor in advance can make a big difference.","8":"BI - Pratit Doshi","9":"7","10":"8","11":"1.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1. It would be helpful if he structured the classes to allocate specific times for each topic and then set aside time for questions or to revisit explanations.\n2. Covering common types of errors encountered while working with SQL would also be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\n","12":"7/May/2024","13":"NotAnswered","14":"8","15":"8","16":"6","index":82,"key":82},{"0":"2024-06-12 21:45:00.739","1":"Test Analyst","2":"8","3":"8","4":"I learn how to write technical blog and manual testing, script writing.

Furthermore, the interactive nature of the sessions fostered engagement and allowed for active participation, which enhanced the learning experience. Overall, the combination of structured content, clear instruction, and interactive engagement made Week 1 & 2 training sessions particularly enjoyable and beneficial.","5":"While the Week 1 & 2 training sessions were highly effective in providing a structured approach to learning and conveying complex ideas clearly, there is still room for improvement in ensuring that the depth of understanding matches the expectations for the role. Specifically, incorporating more in-depth coverage of certain topics, such as C# concepts, could further enhance the participants' knowledge and readiness for the Test Analyst role. Additionally, providing more opportunities for practical application and hands-on exercises could strengthen participants' skills and confidence in applying what they've learned","6":"8","7":"The training materials for Weeks 1 & 2 have provided a solid foundation for participants entering the Test Analyst Programme.

Sharing online resources enhanced our understanding of SQL and allowed us to practice the concepts after class.","5":"Improvements for future classes:\n1. Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3. Make it mandatory for students to keep their cameras on during classes, not just the tutor.

Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2. An introduction to the tutor before the classes begin would help students feel more comfortable, as knowing a bit about the tutor in advance can make a big difference.","8":"BI - Pratit Doshi","9":"7","10":"8","11":"1.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1. It would be helpful if he structured the classes to allocate specific times for each topic and then set aside time for questions or to revisit explanations.\n2.

If he can't explain something he says to look up on YouTube. He spends too much time waiting for the students to tell what to do, instead of him explaining what and how to perform a task.

The sessions provided a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts and skills essential for the role. Additionally, the clarity of instruction and the tutor's ability to convey complex ideas in a digestible manner greatly facilitated understanding. Furthermore, the interactive nature of the sessions fostered engagement and allowed for active participation, which enhanced the learning experience. Overall, the combination of structured content, clear instruction, and interactive engagement made Week 1 & 2 training sessions particularly enjoyable and beneficial.","5":"While the Week 1 & 2 training sessions were highly effective in providing a structured approach to learning and conveying complex ideas clearly, there is still room for improvement in ensuring that the depth of understanding matches the expectations for the role. Specifically, incorporating more in-depth coverage of certain topics, such as C# concepts, could further enhance the participants' knowledge and readiness for the Test Analyst role. Additionally, providing more opportunities for practical application and hands-on exercises could strengthen participants' skills and confidence in applying what they've learned","6":"8","7":"The training materials for Weeks 1 & 2 have provided a solid foundation for participants entering the Test Analyst Programme.

Sharing online resources enhanced our understanding of SQL and allowed us to practice the concepts after class.","5":"Improvements for future classes:\n1. Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3. Make it mandatory for students to keep their cameras on during classes, not just the tutor. This creates the feel of an actual classroom and encourages more active participation since everyone can see each other.","6":"6","7":"The study materials were very helpful for preparing for the weekly sessions, especially in getting familiar with the topics. The pre-program preparation materials were extremely useful, allowing students to read up on SQL, Power BI, and SSIS before the official study materials were provided.\n\nImprovement:\n1. Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2. An introduction to the tutor before the classes begin would help students feel more comfortable, as knowing a bit about the tutor in advance can make a big difference.","8":"BI - Pratit Doshi","9":"7","10":"8","11":"1.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1. It would be helpful if he structured the classes to allocate specific times for each topic and then set aside time for questions or to revisit explanations.\n2. Covering common types of errors encountered while working with SQL would also be beneficial.\n\n\n\n\n","12":"7 May 2024 intake","13":"NotAnswered","14":"8","15":"8","16":"6","index":81,"key":81},{"0":"2024-06-12 21:45:00.739","1":"Test Analyst","2":"8","3":"8","4":"I learn how to write technical blog and manual testing, script writing.

Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program.

Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1.

Allocate more time to thoroughly understand each concept, especially the advanced ones. The pace was a bit quick, and many students are juggling full-time jobs, college courses, etc.\n2. Hold separate live sessions at the beginning to prepare students for what will be covered in the program. This would allow students to focus on understanding the concepts during classes and handle interview preparation separately.\n3. Make it mandatory for students to keep their cameras on during classes, not just the tutor. This creates the feel of an actual classroom and encourages more active participation since everyone can see each other."},{"0":"256","1":"BI - Pratit Doshi","2":"BI / Data Analyst","3":"7 May 2024 intake","4":"Any_comments_about_Week_1_&_2_training_materials_and_what_needs_to_be_improved?","5":"The study materials were very helpful for preparing for the weekly sessions, especially in getting familiar with the topics. The pre-program preparation materials were extremely useful, allowing students to read up on SQL, Power BI, and SSIS before the official study materials were provided.\n\nImprovement:\n1. Use every Monday to not only share the study materials but also to assist students with their software installations. This will ensure everyone is ready for the weekly sessions and save time discussing installation processes, versions, or any other issues.\n2. An introduction to the tutor before the classes begin would help students feel more comfortable, as knowing a bit about the tutor in advance can make a big difference."},{"0":"256","1":"BI - Pratit Doshi","2":"BI / Data Analyst","3":"7 May 2024 intake","4":"Any_comments_about_Week_1_&_2_tutors_and_what_needs_to_be_improved?","5":"1.

He also made sure to let us know that he's always available on chat if we have any questions or need clarification on the topics covered.\n4. Additionally, he shared some great online resources for practicing SQL commands.\n\nImprovements:\n1. It would be helpful if he structured the classes to allocate specific times for each topic and then set aside time for questions or to revisit explanations.\n2.
